# Capstone-Project-2
Springboard - Introductory to Data Science Capstone Projecy
We'd like you to come up with three broad ideas for your Capstone Project. At this point, there’s no need to talk about specific methods and techniques. We just want to get you thinking in that direction and take a baby step. Your mentor is here to guide you through the process of actually identifying an idea to work on. 

There are two broad approaches that students take to identify a Capstone Project topic:

Start with a problem that you care about that you think can be solved with data. Work with your mentor to scope it down, and then look for a data set that solves that problem. The advantage to this approach is that you're much more likely to end up with a project that you're passionate about. However, there's a risk that you may not find a data set that actually works!
Start with a data set that interests you and find a problem that works with it. This is more likely to lead to a workable project sooner, but it may not always be a project you're 100% passionate about.
In reality, most students and mentors use an iterative approach, going back and forth with ideas for data sets and problems until they narrow it down to something that works.

How do you take that initial step of identifying a few ideas? If you're stuck, one of our mentors suggests the following steps:
Find 3 papers, each in an area of interest to you. These papers can be academic papers, articles, industry whitepapers, blog posts etc. Each paper should link to a data set.
Create a writeup with these 3 ideas. Each idea has a link to the paper and the associated data set. For each idea, write a sentence in the form of "X is an interesting problem to solve because Y". This should cover not only what the problem is, but also why it's important and who cares about it.

Submission instructions
Create a document (on Google Doc or Github) with 3 ideas for your Capstone Project
Submit a link to this document for review by your mentor
Once your mentor has reviewed it, post this document to the community for feedback from the rest of your fellow students

Submit a writeup on 3 Capstone project ideas by clicking the "Submit project" button on the right. Review them with your mentor. Your writeup should contain a short blurb for each of your ideas. The blurb should, at high level, describe the problem and the data you’ll be using to solve it.  Post your idea (title and blurb) on the community and solicit feedback from both the mentors and other students.
